GLP-1 Therapies: Diverging Fortunes at Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk
Summary

Divergence in equity performance: Eli Lilly shares have risen more than 35% year-to-date, while Novo Nordisk has declined roughly 50%, reflecting sharply different market expectations around GLP-1 growth, pricing durability, and competitive positioning.

Market share momentum: U.S. prescription data indicates continued share gains for Lilly as adoption of tirzepatide accelerates, placing pressure on Novo Nordisk’s previously dominant position.

Revenue concentration risk: Both companies are now heavily dependent on GLP-1 therapies, making insurance coverage, reimbursement policy, and manufacturing capacity central determinants of financial outcomes.

Large and growing end market: The global obesity and diabetes drug market is expected to grow at a high-teens compound rate over the long term, with credible estimates placing eventual annual revenues in the hundreds of billions, supporting sustained investment focus despite near-term volatility.

A Look at U.S. Healthcare

I generally avoid commenting on other people’s health. The purpose of this note is narrower and more analytical: to highlight a structural public-health reality in the United States that carries clear economic and market implications. In aggregate, Americans have a serious obesity problem.

That reality became unusually vivid to me during the summer of 2024 while visiting Six Flags New England. What stood out was not a small number of outliers, but the overwhelming prevalence of obesity among adults. This observation is not offered as a moral judgment. It is difficult to view this outcome primarily as a failure of individual discipline. The modern American food environment—defined by highly processed foods, calorically dense carbohydrates, widespread fast-food availability, and a complex mix of industrial additives—creates conditions that systematically work against healthy outcomes. Unsurprisingly, the United States spends more per capita on healthcare than any other developed nation, yet consistently delivers poorer results.

Against this backdrop, GLP-1–based weight-loss therapies represent a structural development rather than a passing consumer trend. These drugs do not address the root causes of poor diet, but they have demonstrated measurable effects on weight reduction and metabolic health. Recent efforts to expand insurance coverage and improve affordability meaningfully alter the addressable market for these therapies, with direct implications for the sector’s two dominant players: Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

Market Structure and Competitive Dynamics

From a market perspective, several dynamics warrant closer examination.

First, expanding insurance coverage may increase access and total volumes by more than it compresses unit pricing. This tradeoff may not be fully reflected in current expectations, particularly given the magnitude of valuation compression experienced by Novo Nordisk.

Second, obesity is closely linked to chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers, all of which impose significant long-term costs on insurers and public health systems. To the extent GLP-1 therapies reduce downstream medical expenditures, broader coverage may prove economically rational rather than purely subsidized consumption.

Third, while both companies benefited from substantial share price appreciation over the past three years, recent performance has diverged sharply. Eli Lilly has recovered much of its mid-2025 drawdown, while Novo Nordisk’s decline has been more pronounced and persistent.

Fourth, these developments are unfolding within a market still expected to grow at a high compound rate, with international expansion providing additional optionality. Finally, despite intensifying competition, the industry remains effectively a duopoly—an industry structure that has historically allowed multiple incumbents to grow simultaneously, as seen in other capital-intensive sectors such as commercial aircraft manufacturing.

Financial Divergence and Valuation

Although Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk operate within the same therapeutic category, their financial trajectories have increasingly diverged.

Eli Lilly closed 2024 with approximately $45 billion in revenue and now expects 2025 revenue in the range of $63.0–63.5 billion, driven by continued strength in Mounjaro and Zepbound. Novo Nordisk reported roughly DKK 290 billion (approximately $42 billion) in 2024 revenue, with diabetes and obesity therapies accounting for nearly 94% of total sales. While the company has not issued explicit 2026 guidance, its 2025 outlook was revised lower amid pricing pressure and intensifying competition, resulting in more modest growth expectations than in prior years.

This divergence is reflected in valuation. Lilly trades at a premium forward earnings multiple, supported by durable volume growth and ongoing manufacturing expansion. Novo Nordisk, by contrast, has experienced substantial multiple compression despite persistent profitability and category leadership. For both companies, valuation sensitivity now appears less tied to pipeline uncertainty and more dependent on access, reimbursement dynamics, and the long-term durability of GLP-1 demand.

Insurance Coverage as a Key Constraint

Insurance coverage represents the central constraint on the next phase of GLP-1 adoption.

According to data from KFF, Medicaid prescriptions for GLP-1 drugs increased more than 400% between 2019 and 2023, while gross Medicaid spending rose over 500% during the same period. In 2023 alone, both prescriptions and spending nearly doubled year over year. Despite this rapid growth, GLP-1s accounted for only 0.5% of Medicaid prescriptions but 3.7% of gross drug spending, underscoring both their budgetary impact and still-limited penetration.

Coverage remains uneven but is gradually expanding. As of August 2024, 13 states covered GLP-1s for obesity treatment, typically subject to utilization controls. Importantly, roughly half of non-covering states reported considering future coverage, with several planning expansions in fiscal 2025 or beyond. While cost remains the dominant concern, approximately 40% of states cited potential long-term savings from reduced incidence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer as a factor supporting broader access. Separately, all states are already required to cover GLP-1 formulations for type 2 diabetes, ensuring a baseline level of demand independent of obesity-specific policy decisions.

Policy Signals and International Expansion

Policy considerations may further shape the market. Recent statements by the Trump administration and Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have emphasized improving population health and reducing chronic disease burden, suggesting obesity treatment will remain an active policy topic even in the absence of a federal mandate.

International expansion adds an additional layer of optionality. Novo Nordisk’s recent launch of Ozempic in India—one of the world’s largest diabetes markets—introduces long-duration volume potential, albeit at materially lower price points than in the U.S. While the near-term financial impact is modest, scale and persistence matter over time.

Bottom Line

While individual portfolio decisions necessarily depend on risk tolerance and time horizon, I view the recent sell-off in Novo Nordisk as over-discounting near-term competitive and pricing pressures. At current levels, particularly below $50, Novo Nordisk appears attractive on a long-term basis. Conversely, I rate Eli Lilly a Hold, preferring to reassess entry points following its recent run-up rather than chase momentum at elevated valuations.
